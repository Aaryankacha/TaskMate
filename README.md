# 🚀 TaskMate – Office Workflow Made Simple!

Welcome to **TaskMate**, my first **big project** 🎉
I built this app to help offices and small businesses stay **organized, productive, and a little bit happier** while working!

---

## ✨ What is TaskMate?

TaskMate is a **workflow management app** where:

👨‍💼 **Admin** can:

* ➕ Add Employees
* ✏️ Edit Employee Details
* 📝 Assign Tasks with **attachments** and **due dates**

👨‍💻 **Employees** can:

* 📋 View assigned tasks
* ✅ Mark tasks as completed

💬 **Messenger** – A **mini chat system** so anyone can talk to anyone (because emails are too slow 😄)

🤖 **TaskPilot AI Chatbot** – Your friendly AI buddy who:

* Answers day-to-day questions
* Gives details about your assigned tasks

---

## 🛠 Built With

* **Flutter** – For smooth and beautiful UI
* **Firebase** – For authentication, Firestore database, and real-time messaging
* **Flask Backend** – For file uploads (attachments, profile pictures)

---

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I wanted to build something **practical**, **fun**, and **usable in the real world**.
This project taught me **Flutter**, **Firebase**, **real-time chat**, **file uploads**, and **UI/UX design**.
It’s not just code – it’s my journey from “Hello World” to **my first full-featured app**.

## 😄 Fun Fact

TaskMate’s mascot, **TaskPilot**, was inspired by Minecraft’s happy Ghast… but without the crying 😆

---

## 📌 Future Plans

* 📊 Add analytics for admins
* 🏆 Employee performance dashboard
* 🌐 Web version of TaskMate
