## Notes
- Employees **cannot access admin features** like adding or editing other employees.
- All data is tied to the logged-in employeeâ€™s UID to ensure privacy.
- Firebase Firestore rules should enforce that employees can **only read their own tasks**.
- Dashboard and Task views are meant to provide a smooth user experience with minimal clicks.
